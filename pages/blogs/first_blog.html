        <p>
            So at the end of the spring 2025 semester, I had a little bug in my brain saying "make a website, it will be
            so fun and cool". I had an internship during the summer (more on that in another post at some point), so I
            didn't really have the time to start on it during then. Towards the end of the internship I was just
            browsing epik.com and I saw "wyattborden.com" for only $15.99 a year. When I saw that, I bought it on
            impulse. I had to make sure that no one would have it. After that I had to learn HTML and CSS and then here
            we are. Hopefully, you will be able to enjoy this space, and I will not forget to update it. There is a high
            possibility that this website will just rot.
        </p>
        <p>Some of the things that I hope to have on here are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>About me page</li>
            <li>Projects page</li>
            <li>Blogs</li>
            <li>Other things that I can't think of at the moment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In a pefect world, I want this place will work as an extension of my resume. A place were I can have more
            information about myself that recruiters can look at to learn more about me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, I will get on with making the website so there is something to look at.
